We’ve got millions of documents that need to be digitized, OCRed, and analyzed using machine learning for information like, titles, authors, etc. but we also want to automatically extract and create time-series data from pictures of graphs! Plus, we fully endorse exploration of transformer models to semantic reasoning over this textual data.

Using robots that are resident on ships and within ports and harbors that are supervised by remote operations specialists,
Greensea’s service is scalable worldwide at a fraction of the cost required by traditional husbandry methods.
A key deliverable of Greensea’s service is a cloud-based intelligence platform called EverClean IQ. This product allows ship owners and operators to get unprecedented access to the health and status of their hulls, enabling them to make more accurate decisions about cleaning frequency and maintenance events. Using the data collected from the hull, Greensea IQ is creating object recognition and machine learning models to enable ship owners to predict fouling levels and maintenance events to ensure that ships are running as efficiently as possible, saving fuel and reducing the global shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emission footprint.

Using robots that are resident on ships and within ports and harbors that are supervised by remote operations specialists,
Greensea’s service is scalable worldwide at a fraction of the cost required by traditional husbandry methods.
A key deliverable of Greensea’s service is a cloud-based intelligence platform called EverClean IQ. This product allows ship owners and operators to get unprecedented access to the health and status of their hulls, enabling them to make more accurate decisions about cleaning frequency and maintenance events. Using the data collected from the hull, Greensea IQ is creating object recognition and machine learning models to enable ship owners to predict fouling levels and maintenance events to ensure that ships are running as efficiently as possible, saving fuel and reducing the global shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emission footprint.

Senior Data Scientist,$111K - $149K (Glassdoor est.),"Senior Data Scientist
Greensea is revolutionizing ship husbandry using autonomous robots and artificial intelligence. Through a subscription service called EverClean, Greensea robots
continuously clean ship hulls and provide regular hull surveys. Clean ship hulls result in substantially reduced operating costs, lower carbon emissions, and reduced environmental impacts while regular survey data provides the intelligence ship owners need to make on-time maintenance decisions. Using robots that are resident on ships and within ports and harbors that are supervised by remote operations specialists,
Greensea’s service is scalable worldwide at a fraction of the cost required by traditional husbandry methods.
A key deliverable of Greensea’s service is a cloud-based intelligence platform called EverClean IQ. This product allows ship owners and operators to get unprecedented access to the health and status of their hulls, enabling them to make more accurate decisions about cleaning frequency and maintenance events. Using the data collected from the hull, Greensea IQ is creating object recognition and machine learning models to enable ship owners to predict fouling levels and maintenance events to ensure that ships are running as efficiently as possible, saving fuel and reducing the global shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emission footprint.
